He reacts to comments by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at the Munich Security Conference about implementing a wealth tax, stating that taxation authority rests with Congress under the 16th Amendment and condemning annual taxes based on estimated net worth. He also highlights AOC’s response to a question about whether the U.S. should commit troops to defend Taiwan, arguing her answer was vague and showed unpreparedness. Garrett then points to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer deflecting a question about what “victory” looks like in Ukraine, and compares it to a past clip of Vice President Kamala Harris appearing unprepared when asked about U.S. support and refugee infrastructure related to Ukraine during a joint appearance with Poland’s President Duda. Garrett concludes that these moments reflect ignorance of or disregard for the Constitution and promotes the channel’s rule-of-law focus.</p>"
