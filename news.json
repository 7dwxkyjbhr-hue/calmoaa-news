They can also help you connect with other caregivers and provide you with valuable information to help you care for the Veteran and yourself. Your caregiver support team can provide one-on-one support to you. They're available to listen to you and your needs. They can provide coaching both around the skills you need to care for the changing needs of the veteran you care for, or coaching to help you develop goals related to your own health. They can enroll you in a support group where you can connect with other caregivers. They can even connect you with a peer support mentor, another caregiver who is walking a similar journey. It can help you enhance your coping skills, help you manage the normal emotions that come along with caregiving, and decrease the stress you may be feeling as a caregiver. By engaging in skills training or coaching you can increase your confidence as you learn new tools to help you manage the day to day care needs. \n\nBy connecting with other caregivers, you can decrease any sense of isolation you may be feeling and increase your feelings of connectedness. Caregiver Support Teams draw upon your strengths as a person and as a caregiver and help you create a plan with the focus on caring for you. The best thing to do is to go to https://www.caregiver.va.gov and click on find your local Caregiver Support Coordinator.
