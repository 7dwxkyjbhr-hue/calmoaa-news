    "summary": "Sgt. Henry David Volpe, an automotive maintenance technician with 2nd Marine Logistics Group, has successfully developed HANX, the Marine Corps’ first NDAA-compliant, 3D-printed drone platform. Developed at the II MEF Innovation Campus in just 90 days, the HANX drone represents a major leap in tactical manufacturing by providing a low-cost, modular system that is resilient against adversary software. By utilizing 3D printing and off-the-shelf parts that meet rigorous security standards, Sgt. Volpe and his team have moved drone production from external contractors directly into the hands of Marines. This \"by Marines, for Marines\" innovation aligns with the Department of War’s \"Drone Dominance\" initiative, offering a versatile tool for reconnaissance or one-way attack missions that can be built and modified anywhere in the fleet.<br /> \n<img alt=\"U.S. Marine Corps Sgt.
